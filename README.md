We will explain the reasons and effects of a second wave of influenza. This interests us because it can show the real world effects of human attitudes and actions regarding the spread of the virus. This would interest scientists, specifically epidemiologists and sociologists. 

We expect to produce a graph with multiple peaks, decreasing in magnitude over time.

The graphs that we produce will show the effects of public health interventions and viral adaptation. This type of graph could be used to educate the public about virus containment measures or to plan future public health efforts.
